TODO
==================

Global
-----------------
 * Do I need to remove error messages form the library ?
 Is this must be handle by the views rather than the controllers ?

 * Is it better to stop after the first validation error of each input ?

 * Is it better to create filter, according to options, just when/if it is called ?
 


FormFilter
-----------------

 * addCustomFilterDefaultOptions
 * addCustomFilterDefaultError
